# TransLOB Transformers for limit order books
In this work I will present the implementation in pytorch of the model proposed in [Transformers for limit order books](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00130.pdf) by James Wallbridge.

In the notebook is presented a comprehensive machine learning pipeline that encompasses loading the dataset, applying labeling methods, creating datasets and dataloaders, and ultimately, executing the training, validation, and testing processes.

# Usage

To run the code you just have to download the [FI-2010 dataset](https://etsin.fairdata.fi/dataset/73eb48d7-4dbc-4a10-a52a-da745b47a649/data) and change the data path, then the notebook will do the rest, including the training and testing.
